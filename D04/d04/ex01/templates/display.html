<h1>Display process of a static page</h1>
<p>
    <p>
        1. User Sends a Request:
        The process begins when a user enters a URL in their web browser or clicks a link that points to the specific URL of
        the static web page. The browser sends an HTTP GET request to the web server.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. Web Server Receives the Request:
        The web server, which could be Apache, Nginx, or another server software, receives the incoming HTTP request.
    </p>
    <p>    
        3. URL Routing:
        The web server examines the URL of the request and determines which application or view should handle it. In the
        context of Django, there is a configuration file (usually urls.py) that maps URLs to specific view functions.
    </p>
    <p>

        4. View Function Handling:
        The view function associated with the URL in question is invoked. This view function is responsible for processing
        the request and generating a response. In this case, since you're dealing with a static web page, the view doesn't
        need to perform any database queries or complex logic.
    </p>
    <p>

        5. Template Rendering:
        Within the view function, if a template is involved, the template engine is used to render the template. A template
        is essentially an HTML file with placeholders for dynamic content. The template engine replaces these placeholders
        with actual data. In Django, the built-in template engine uses a syntax that allows for variable substitution,
        loops, conditionals, and more.
    </p>
    <p>

        6. Generating the Response:
        Once the template is rendered and the dynamic data (if any) is inserted, the view function creates an HTTP response
        object. This response object contains the final HTML content that the browser will display.
    </p>
    <p>

        7. Sending the Response:
        The response is sent back to the web server by the view function, which then forwards it to the user's browser as an
        HTTP response.
    </p>
    <p>

        8. Browser Receives and Renders:
        The user's browser receives the HTTP response containing the HTML content. It processes the HTML, along with any
        included CSS and JavaScript, to render the web page on the user's screen.
    </p>
    <p>

        9. Displaying the Web Page:
        The static web page, generated from the template and processed by the view, is now displayed to the user in their
        browser. The user can see the content and interact with any client-side elements.
    </p>
    <p>
        10. User Interaction:
        If the static web page contains any interactive elements like forms, buttons, or links, the user can interact with
        them. This might lead to more requests being sent to the server, starting the process again for a different URL or
        action.
    </p>
    <p>

        In summary, the process involves the user's request being handled by a view function that renders a template (if
        needed) and generates an HTML response. This response is then sent back to the user's browser, which renders the
        static web page for the user to see and interact with.
    </p>
