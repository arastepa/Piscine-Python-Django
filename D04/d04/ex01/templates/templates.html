<h1> Template engine</h1>
<p>
    Django's default template engine is a component of the Django web framework that enables the creation and rendering
    of dynamic web pages. It allows developers to separate the presentation layer from the business logic of a web
    application by using template files that include placeholders for dynamic content and control structures. Let's dive
    into the functioning of Django's default template engine:

    <p>

        p1. Template Creation:
        Developers create HTML templates by embedding Django template tags and variables within the HTML code. Template tags
        are enclosed in &#123;&#37; &#37;&#125; and are used for control flow and logic, while template variables are enclosed in &#123;&#123; &#125;&#125; and
        are used to display dynamic data.
    </p> 
    <p>

        2. Template Loading:
        Django's template engine includes a template loader that determines where to find template files. It searches in
        predefined locations, including application-specific template directories and the project's global template
        directory. This allows for modularity and organization of templates.
    </p>
    <p>

        3. Context Data:
        When rendering a template, developers provide a context dictionary containing data that the template needs. The
        context dictionary holds key-value pairs where the keys are the variable names used in the template and the values
        are the actual data. This context data is used to populate the template with dynamic content.
    </p>
    <p>

        4. Template Tags and Filters:
        Django's template engine offers a wide range of built-in template tags and filters. Template tags provide control
        flow mechanisms like loops (for and while) and conditionals (if), enabling dynamic content generation. Filters
        modify the output of variables by applying functions like date formatting, string manipulation, and more.
    </p> 
    <p>

        5. Template Inheritance:
        Django's template engine supports template inheritance, promoting the creation of reusable and consistent UI
        components. Developers can define a base template with common structure and placeholders, and then create child
        templates that extend the base template. This encourages the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
    </p> 
    <p>

        6. Rendering Process:
        When a view function is executed and a template needs to be rendered, the template engine processes the template
        file. It interprets template tags, variables, and control structures, and substitutes them with actual data from the
        context dictionary. This process generates a final HTML output.
    </p>    
    <p>

        7. Caching Mechanism:
        To enhance performance, Django's template engine includes a caching mechanism. Once a template is rendered, it can
        be cached so that subsequent requests for the same template with the same context data don't need to be re-rendered.
        This improves response times for frequently accessed templates.
        
    </p>
    <p>

        8. Generating the Response:
        After the template engine has processed the template and inserted dynamic data, the view function creates an HTTP
        response containing the final HTML output. This response is then sent back to the user's browser for rendering.
    </p>
    <p>

        9. User Interaction:
        If the rendered HTML includes forms, buttons, or links, users can interact with these elements. Subsequent
        interactions trigger new requests to the server, restarting the process as needed.
    </p>  
    <p>

        In summary, Django's default template engine facilitates the creation of dynamic web pages by allowing developers to
        combine HTML structure with dynamic content using template tags, variables, and control structures. This separation
        of concerns makes it easier to maintain, update, and collaborate on web applications, while also providing tools for
        creating efficient and reusable templates.
